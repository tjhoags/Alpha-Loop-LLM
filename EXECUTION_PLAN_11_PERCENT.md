## 📊 Strategy Allocation (Portfolio Mix)

### Conservative Approach (60% probability of success):
- **40%**: Earnings surprise momentum (2-3% per week, high consistency)
- **30%**: Small-cap technical breakouts (2-4% per week)
- **20%**: Options income strategies (1-2% per week)
- **10%**: Cash reserve for opportunities

### ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE Approach (For 17% Target):
- **30%**: Short squeeze plays (need 1-2 moonshots)
- **25%**: Earnings surprise momentum (consistent base)
- **20%**: Options flow following (3-7% weekly)
- **15%**: Small-cap breakout momentum
- **10%**: Leveraged ETF day trades (risky but fast)
- **0%**: NO cash reserve - fully deployed

**Risk Level**: VERY HIGH
**Win Probability**: 50-60% (but potential for 20-30%+ if lucky)

**Expected Returns**:
- Week 1: 5-8% (find 1 squeeze candidate)
- Week 2: 6-10% (earnings + momentum peak)
- Week 3: 4-6% (lock in gains)
- **Total**: 17-25%+ (if we catch a squeeze)

**Critical Success Factor**: Finding 1-2 short squeeze candidates that move 30-100%
