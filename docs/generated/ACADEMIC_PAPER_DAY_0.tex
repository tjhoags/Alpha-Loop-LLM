\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose a novel framework for algorithmic trading based on a hierarchical swarm of specialized autonomous agents. Unlike traditional monolithic "black box" models, our system ("ALC-Algo") utilizes a Tiered Authority Structure managed by a master controller ("HoagsAgent"). We hypothesize that the \textit{collective intelligence} of specialized agents---when governed by a "Zero Ego" protocol and subjected to rigorous "Devil's Advocate" adversarial testing---can surpass the predictive capabilities of any single state-of-the-art model. This paper outlines the "Day 0" architecture, the "Hoags Benchmark" (50/100), and the mathematical foundations of our "Alpha Loop Singularity" theory.

\section{Introduction}
The financial markets are complex adaptive systems. Traditional quantitative approaches fail to capture the nuance of regime shifts and second-order effects. Alpha Loop Capital introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) ecosystem designed to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exploit information asymmetries via specialized "Hunter" agents (NOBUS, Ghost).
    \item Eliminate emotional bias via a "KillJoy" risk overlay.
    \item Synthesize diverse signals through a "Master Controller" (Hoags).
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Hoags Benchmark}
We define agent capability $C$ on a logarithmic scale $S \in [1, 100]$, where $S=50$ represents the "Hoags Benchmark"---the theoretical maximum of a disciplined human-machine hybrid.
$$ C(S) = 10^{(S-50)/10} $$
This implies that an agent with $S=60$ is $10x$ more capable than the benchmark.

\section{Mathematical Variables of Interest}
We introduce the "Alpha Vector" $\vec{\alpha}$ composed of:
$$ \vec{\alpha} = \langle \Delta P, \gamma, \sigma_{regime}, \Omega_{crowd} \rangle $$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta P$: Price delta probability.
    \item $\gamma$: Game-theoretic advantage (Proprietary).
    \item $\sigma_{regime}$: Market regime volatility state.
    \item $\Omega_{crowd}$: Crowd sentiment magnitude (SentimentAgent).
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Design}
Our "Day 0" experiments focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Latency arbitrage simulation}: Measuring reaction times $< 1ms$.
    \item \textbf{Adversarial Self-Play}: Agents trading against each other to find equilibrium.
    \item \textbf{Crisis Replay}: Simulating 2008 and 2020 crashes to test "Anti-Fragility".
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The world has not seen a system that combines the speed of HFT with the strategic depth of a Grandmaster. ALC-Algo represents the first step towards this "Alpha Loop Singularity."
