# Competitive Landscape: Scheduling + Payments

## Key Players
- **Calendly:** UX leader; payments optional; routing limited on lower tiers.
- **SavvyCal:** Strong personalization; payments present; lacks native lead enrichment.
- **Chili Piper:** Enterprise routing; complex; expensive; slow to activate for SMBs.
- **OnceHub/YouCanBookMe:** Broad feature sets; weaker PLG; less payments-first.

## Gaps to Exploit
- Payments-first default; not an add-on.
- Fast onboarding (3 steps): connect calendar, set price, share link.
- Team routing without complex admin setup.
- Lead enrichment + export/webhooks on Pro plan.
- Templates for agencies/consultants to launch in minutes.

## Positioning
- “Get paid before you meet.” — reduce no-shows and filter for intent.
- “Route every lead to the right teammate automatically.”
- “Embed your paid booking flow anywhere.”

## Pricing Pressure Points
- Calendly/SavvyCal SMB tiers: $10–$20/user/month.
- Chili Piper: >$30/user/month; requires sales motion.
- We can price at **$19/$49/$99** with clear value on payments and routing.
