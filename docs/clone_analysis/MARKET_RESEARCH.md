# Market Research: Scheduling + Payments (InstantMeet)

## Market Size (Directional)
- Scheduling software market: ~$450M ARR across incumbents (Calendly, SavvyCal, Chili Piper).
- Services and consulting (US): ~3.5M small businesses; high willingness to pay for paid discovery calls.
- Payment volume for paid meetings: long-tail of agencies/consultants charging $50–$500 per session.

## Demand Signals
- Growing adoption of paid intro calls to filter leads.
- Teams want round-robin routing to share load and reduce drop-offs.
- Post-booking enrichment improves conversion to paying customer.

## Customer Segments
- Agencies / consultants (paid discovery calls).
- Sales teams (round-robin demo routing).
- Customer success / onboarding (paid setup sessions).
- Coaches/trainers (simple pay-to-book).

## Pain Points
- No-shows and low-intent leads waste time.
- Payment collection is bolted on, not native.
- Routing to the right rep is manual or requires complex setup.
- Lack of enrichment on leads from booking links.

## Opportunities
- Native payment-first flow reduces no-shows and increases intent.
- Templates per persona (agency, sales, CS) for faster activation.
- Simple embeddable widget for websites and proposals.
- Export/webhooks to CRM for higher-tier plans.

## Competitive Snapshot
- Calendly: excellent UX, but payments/routing are add-ons.
- SavvyCal: strong UX; payments present but not primary.
- Chili Piper: heavy enterprise focus; expensive; complex setup.
- Opportunity: be the fastest path to paid, routed meetings for SMB/teams.
