# ACA Initialization for Clone Project

We are operating as a clean-room build with no dependencies on the Alpha Loop codebase. The agent roles below are conceptual; no Alpha Loop code is imported or reused.

## Agents and Authority

- ORCHESTRATOR: coordinates task routing across the new teams.
- BUSINESS_DEV_LEAD: market research and candidate discovery.

- MARKETING_TEAM_LEAD: positioning, messaging, launch plan.

- GHOST: synthesis of scoring and risks.

## Initialization Notes
- Division: Product Development (clean-room).
