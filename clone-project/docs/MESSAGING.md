# Messaging Guide

## Core Story
- Time is expensive. Free intro calls waste it.
- InstantMeet makes payments the default and routes every lead to the right person.
- Share a link, get paid, reduce no-shows, and keep the team busy with qualified calls.

## One-Liners
- “Get paid before you meet.”
- “Round-robin your leads; never juggle calendars again.”
- “Drop a paid booking widget into any page.”

## Objection Handling
- **“Will this hurt conversion?”** Paid-first filters low-intent leads; higher close rates offset volume loss.
- **“Is setup hard?”** 3 steps: set price, choose slots, share link. No complex routing rules required.
- **“Will it work with my stack?”** Webhooks + CSV export in Pro; native integrations can follow.

## CTAs
- “Start free — add your price and share your link.”
- “Turn on payments for your next demo.”
- “Share with your team and route leads automatically.”
