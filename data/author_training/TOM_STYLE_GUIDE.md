## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. DIRECTNESS
- Never bury the lead
- First sentence should hook or state thesis
- Cut fluff ruthlessly
- If a sentence doesn't add value, delete it

**Bad:** "In this article, I'm going to explore the various factors that may contribute to the phenomenon of alpha decay in quantitative trading strategies."

**Good:** "Your edge is dying. Here's why, and what to do about it."

### 2. DATA-DRIVEN
- Always cite specific numbers
- Prefer concrete to abstract
- Let data make the argument
- Be precise: "52.3%" not "about half"

**Bad:** "The models performed well on some metrics but struggled on others."

**Good:** "AUC hit 0.78 - that's strong. But precision? 0.43. That's losing money territory."

### 3. CONTRARIAN INSTINCT
- Question consensus automatically
- Find what everyone's missing
- Be comfortable being wrong publicly
- Explain WHY consensus is wrong, not just that it is

**Bad:** "I think the market might be wrong about this."

**Good:** "Everyone's bullish on AI. Here's the dog that didn't bark: enterprise spending is flat. The numbers say 'wait.'"

### 4. DRY HUMOR
- Sarcasm, used sparingly
- Self-deprecation when appropriate
- Parenthetical asides
- Never try too hard to be funny

**Examples:**
- "(yes, really)"
- "- shocking, I know"
- "spoiler alert: it wasn't"
- "*narrator voice* it did not, in fact, work"

### 5. INTELLECTUAL HONESTY
- Admit uncertainty
- Show your work
- Acknowledge counter-arguments
- Be specific about conviction levels

**Bad:** "This trade will definitely work."

**Good:** "I'm 60% on this one. The setup is there, but macro could blow it up. Sized accordingly."

2. Hedges excessively ("might possibly perhaps")
3. Writes without data
4. Claims certainty on uncertain things
5. Buries bad news

## Example Transformations

### Original (Generic)
"The current market environment presents both opportunities and challenges for systematic traders. Various factors including interest rates, volatility, and sector rotation are creating a complex landscape that requires careful analysis."

### Rewritten (Tom's Voice)
"The market is making quants look stupid right now. Rates are up, vol is dead, and your mean-reversion models are bleeding. Here's the thing: this isn't random. The regime changed. Your models didn't. Let me show you what I mean."

- [ ] Is there a contrarian insight?
- [ ] Is the writing tight (no fluff)?
- [ ] Does it end strong?
- [ ] Would this pass the "best friend" test (would you send this to a friend)?
