## Article 1: Why I'm Building My Own Hedge Fund (And You Probably Shouldn't)

Look, I'm going to be honest with you. Starting a hedge fund in 2025 is objectively insane.

The industry is dying. Assets under management have been declining for years. Fees are compressed - the classic 2-and-20 model is basically dead outside of the elite tier. Regulatory compliance costs keep rising. And every single person with a Bloomberg terminal thinks they can replicate your alpha with ETFs.

So naturally, I'm building one.

Here's the thing: I didn't wake up one day and think "you know what sounds fun? Navigating CFTC regulations and courting institutional allocators." The decision to build Alpha Loop Capital wasn't inspirational - it was inevitable.

### The Origin Story (Without the Silicon Valley Bullshit)

I've been trading my own money for years. Started small, made mistakes, lost money, made it back, repeated the cycle. The usual path. But somewhere around 2022, I noticed something: my systematic strategies were consistently beating my discretionary ones.

The numbers were clear. My rule-based approaches had a Sharpe ratio around 1.8. My "gut feel" trades? Maybe 0.6 on a good year. The math was screaming at me.

So I built more systems. Backtested obsessively. Started incorporating machine learning models. Built agent-based frameworks that could analyze data faster than I could drink my morning coffee. And the performance kept improving.

By mid-2024, I was managing a seven-figure personal portfolio with strategies that had three years of live track record. Drawdowns under 15%. Sharpe above 2.0. Win rate in the 60s.

That's when the question hit me: what am I doing this for?

### The Real Reason (Not the Pitch Deck Version)

Everyone who starts a fund tells you it's about "democratizing alpha" or "bringing institutional-grade strategies to retail investors" or some other LinkedIn-optimized nonsense.

Bottom line: I'm building Alpha Loop Capital because I want to prove something.

Not to investors. Not to the market. To myself.

I want to know if the systems I've built can scale. I want to see if my thesis about AI-enhanced systematic trading actually holds up under institutional scrutiny. I want to find out if I'm as good at this as I think I am - or if I've just been lucky.

Spoiler alert: there's a very real chance it's the latter.

### What Nobody Tells You About Starting a Fund

The actual trading? That's maybe 20% of the work.

The other 80% is:
- Legal structure and regulatory compliance (so much paperwork)
- Building operational infrastructure that doesn't break
- Risk management systems that work when everything goes wrong
- Investor relations (yes, you have to talk to humans)
- Performance reporting that satisfies auditors
- Technology stack that can handle market hours without melting
- Hiring people who are smarter than you (harder than it sounds)

I've spent more time in the last six months dealing with prime brokerage agreements than actually analyzing markets. I've had more conversations with lawyers than with traders. I've looked at more compliance checklists than trade setups.

It's brutally unsexy.

### The Economics Are Terrible (Let's Do The Math)

Here's what most people don't understand about fund economics:

Let's say you launch with $5 million AUM (which is actually a decent start). You're charging 1.5% management fee and 20% performance fee because you're not Tiger Global and nobody's giving you 2-and-20.

Year 1 revenue breakdown:
- Management fees: $75,000 (before expenses)
- Performance fees: Assuming 20% returns, that's $200,000 profit split = $40,000

Total: $115,000

Now subtract:
- Legal and compliance: $30,000
- Technology and data: $25,000
- Prime brokerage and execution: $15,000
- Operational overhead: $20,000
- Your own living expenses: $50,000+

You're basically breaking even. Maybe losing money.

The question is: can you survive long enough to scale?

Most funds can't. The median hedge fund closes within 3-5 years. The math doesn't work until you hit $25-50 million AUM minimum. And getting there requires either exceptional performance, exceptional marketing, or exceptional luck.

Usually all three.

### Why You Probably Shouldn't Do This

Listen, I'm not writing this to inspire you to quit your job and start a fund. I'm writing this because the narrative around fund management is completely divorced from reality.

You shouldn't start a fund if:

1. **You haven't traded your own money successfully for years.** Paper trading doesn't count. Backtests don't count. You need live P&L experience.

2. **You can't survive 2-3 years with minimal income.** The early years are financial hell. Have savings or secondary income.

3. **You don't have edge.** And no, "I'm smart and work hard" is not edge. Everyone in this game is smart and works hard.

4. **You can't handle being wrong publicly.** Your performance is transparent. Bad months are brutal psychologically.

5. **You want work-life balance.** LOL. No.

The consensus is wrong because everyone sees the successful funds and thinks "I could do that." What you don't see is the graveyard of failed funds. The talented traders who couldn't raise assets. The systematic strategies that worked in backtest but died in production. The brilliant people who burned through their savings and had to go back to working for someone else.

### So Why Am I Doing This?

Because the alternative is spending the rest of my life wondering "what if?"

I've built something I believe in. The systems work. The infrastructure is solid. The strategy has edge. And if I don't take this shot now, I'll regret it forever.

Is it rational? Probably not.

Is it necessary? For me, yes.

Will it work? We'll see how this plays out.

I'm giving myself 18 months. If the fund isn't at $10+ million AUM with institutional-quality performance by then, I'll shut it down and go do something else. No ego. No sunk cost fallacy. Just honest evaluation of whether this thing has product-market fit.

The numbers will tell the story.

### What I'm Building

Alpha Loop Capital runs systematic, AI-enhanced strategies across global macro and volatility. We use agent-based frameworks to process information faster than human discretionary traders. We're benchmark-agnostic and alpha-focused.

Target metrics:
- Sharpe ratio > 2.0
- Max drawdown < 20%
- Win rate > 55%
- Low correlation to equity indices

Are we there yet? Ask me in a year.

I'm documenting the entire journey here - the wins, the losses, the operational headaches, the regulatory nightmares, all of it. Not because it's glamorous (it's not), but because the industry needs more transparency about what this actually looks like.

### Bottom Line

Starting a hedge fund is one of the hardest, most expensive, most stressful things you can do in finance. The failure rate is astronomical. The economics are brutal until you reach scale. The regulatory burden is crushing. And the market doesn't care about your feelings.

I'm doing it anyway.

Not because I think I'm special. But because I've built something worth testing in the real world, and I'm willing to risk being wrong to find out if it works.

If you're thinking about starting a fund: make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Understand the economics. Have realistic expectations. And be prepared to fail publicly.

And if you're just here to watch me either build something real or crash and burn spectacularly? Buckle up. It's going to be interesting either way.

NFA, obviously.

## Article 2: The Market Is Lying to You (Here's What It's Actually Saying)

Everyone thinks the market is easy to read right now.

Bulls point to strong employment data, resilient consumer spending, and corporate earnings that keep beating expectations. The S&P is up 18% year-to-date (yes, really). VIX is sitting around 13. Credit spreads are tight. Everything looks fine.

Bears counter with elevated valuations, inverted yield curves (well, recently un-inverted), commercial real estate implosion fears, and geopolitical chaos. They've been calling for a crash since 2023.

Here's the thing: both sides are missing what the market is actually telling us.

### What The Headlines Say vs. What The Data Says

The consensus narrative goes something like this: "The economy is strong, earnings are good, rates are stabilizing, therefore equities should continue higher with modest pullbacks."

Look, I'm not saying the consensus is always wrong. But when everyone agrees on a narrative, it's usually because they're all looking at the same surface-level data and drawing the same obvious conclusions.

The numbers tell a different story.

Let's start with volatility. The VIX is low - around 13-14 - which everyone interprets as "market is calm, risk is low." But the VIX measures implied volatility of 30-day SPX options. It tells you what options traders think will happen in the next month.

Want to know what's more interesting? Look at the volatility term structure. The spread between 30-day and 90-day implied vol has been widening. Translation: the market is pricing in calm near-term conditions but significantly more uncertainty beyond that.

Why? Because nobody knows what happens next with rates, inflation, or the macro regime. The market isn't calm - it's paralyzed by competing scenarios.

### The Hidden Message in Correlation Breakdowns

Here's what the market is actually saying, if you know where to look:

Cross-asset correlations have been breaking down. Bonds aren't behaving like bonds. Gold is acting weird. Crypto is completely untethered from its traditional drivers. And equity sector rotations are happening at a pace that suggests nobody has conviction.

In the last 60 days alone:
- Tech has rotated in and out of favor three separate times
- Financials have had two violent reversals
- Energy has moved 8%+ in both directions within weeks
- Treasury yields have gyrated without clear macro justification

This isn't a market with strong directional conviction. This is a market that's confused about the regime we're in.

The question is: are we in a late-cycle expansion, early-cycle recovery, or something entirely different that doesn't fit historical patterns?

The market doesn't know. And when the market doesn't know, it chops.

### What Everyone Is Missing: The Liquidity Puzzle

Everyone's talking about the Fed's rate policy. Nobody's talking about liquidity conditions - and that's the actual story.

Overnight reverse repo facility usage has collapsed from $2+ trillion to under $300 billion. Bank reserves are tightening. Treasury issuance is massive. And the Fed's balance sheet runoff continues.

What does this mean in English? The pool of excess liquidity that's been floating all assets is draining. Not quickly enough to cause a crisis (yet), but steadily enough that risk assets have less cushion.

But here's the twist: equity valuations haven't adjusted to reflect this. The S&P is trading at 19-20x forward earnings while liquidity conditions are normalizing. That premium made sense when free money was everywhere. Does it make sense now?

Spoiler alert: probably not.

The market is lying to you when it says "everything is fine." What it's actually saying is "we're priced for perfection in an environment where perfection is increasingly unlikely."

### The Volatility Suppression Trade

Let's talk about why the VIX is artificially low.

There's a massive volatility suppression trade happening through systematic strategies. CTAs, risk parity funds, and vol-targeting funds mechanically sell volatility when realized vol is low. This creates a self-reinforcing loop: low vol begets lower vol until something breaks.

We've seen this movie before. 2018 (Volmageddon). 2020 (COVID crash). 2022 (inflation shock).

The pattern is always the same:
1. Volatility gets compressed to unsustainable levels
2. Everyone gets comfortable with low vol
3. A catalyst hits (doesn't have to be huge)
4. Systematic strategies all try to unwind at once
5. Volatility explodes and market drops violently

Are we there yet? Not quite. But the setup is forming.

Current 30-day realized vol on SPX is around 11%. Historical average is 16-17%. Every time realized vol has been this suppressed for this long, a vol spike followed within 3-6 months.

The math is simple: volatility is mean-reverting. The longer it stays compressed, the more violent the eventual expansion.

### What The Credit Markets Are Actually Saying

Everyone thinks X: credit spreads are tight, therefore credit markets are healthy.

The consensus is wrong because tight spreads don't mean low risk - they mean investors are being under-compensated for risk.

High yield spreads are around 300bps over treasuries. Investment grade is around 100bps. These are levels we typically see at cycle peaks, not mid-cycle.

But here's what's fascinating: credit default swap markets are pricing in materially higher default risk than cash bond spreads suggest. The basis between CDS and cash spreads has widened significantly.

Translation: sophisticated credit investors (who use CDS) see more risk than retail investors (who buy cash bonds). This divergence usually resolves with spreads widening, not tightening.

Bottom line: credit markets are flashing yellow, not green. But everyone's looking at the wrong metric.

### The Real Message: Regime Uncertainty

What the market is actually telling you - if you aggregate all these signals - is that we're in a period of profound regime uncertainty.

Are we heading into:
- A soft landing with moderate growth and stable inflation?
- A hard landing with recession and disinflation?
- A re-acceleration of inflation requiring more tightening?
- A new paradigm where previous relationships don't hold?

The market doesn't know. And rather than admit uncertainty, it's pricing in a Goldilocks scenario that requires everything to go right.

This is where opportunity lives.

### How To Actually Trade This

I'm not going to tell you "the market is going to crash" or "we're going higher." That's pundit bullshit.

What I will tell you is how I'm positioning for regime uncertainty:

1. **Long volatility exposure.** Not because I know when vol will spike, but because it's mathematically cheap relative to historical patterns. I'm using out-of-the-money puts and vol swaps, not VIX calls (which are lottery tickets).

2. **Reduced directional equity exposure.** Not zero - I'm not calling a crash. But when risk-reward is asymmetric, you size down. My equity book is running at 60% of normal leverage.

3. **Increased diversification across uncorrelated strategies.** Macro, relative value, volatility arb, trend following. When you don't know the regime, you want strategies that work in different environments.

4. **Short credit via CDS.** Small position, but the risk-reward is compelling when CDS is pricing in more risk than cash spreads.

5. **Cash position larger than usual.** Liquidity is ammunition. When everyone else is forced to de-risk, you want to be buying.

Is this going to make me a hero if markets crash? No - long vol will help but I'm not massively short. Will I get crushed if markets rip higher? No - I still have equity exposure and trend-following strategies that will capture upside.

What I'm optimizing for is: not looking like an idiot regardless of what happens.

### What You Should Actually Be Watching

Forget the headline numbers. Here's what matters:

1. **Volatility term structure:** Is the curve steepening or flattening? Steepening = rising uncertainty about future.

2. **Cross-asset correlation:** Are traditional hedges (bonds, gold) working? If not, portfolio construction breaks down.

3. **Liquidity indicators:** Bid-ask spreads, market depth, overnight repo rates. When liquidity dries up, everything gets worse fast.

4. **Credit basis:** CDS vs cash spread differential. When it widens, credit stress is building.

5. **Systematic strategy positioning:** CTA trend signals, vol control fund exposure. When they all flip at once, markets move violently.

These aren't sexy. They don't make good CNBC soundbites. But they tell you what's actually happening beneath the surface.

### Plot Twist: Maybe I'm Wrong

Here's the thing about market analysis: you can have the perfect read on conditions and still lose money because timing is everything.

Maybe the liquidity drain doesn't matter because earnings growth is strong enough to support valuations. Maybe volatility stays suppressed for another year because systematic flows are that powerful. Maybe credit spreads tighten further because there's literally no alternative for yield-hungry investors.

I've been wrong before. I'll be wrong again.

But what I won't do is pretend the market is simple when it's complex. I won't ignore warning signals because the headlines say everything is fine. And I won't position for certainty when the data screams uncertainty.

### The Bottom Line

The market is lying to you when it says everything is fine. Low volatility doesn't mean low risk - it means risk is being suppressed and will eventually mean-revert. Tight credit spreads don't mean healthy credit markets - they mean investors are being under-compensated for risk. And calm price action doesn't mean calm conditions - it means paralysis in the face of competing scenarios.

What the market is actually saying: "I don't know what regime we're in, so I'm going to chop around and punish anyone with strong directional conviction until something forces me to make a decision."

Trade accordingly.

Or don't. NFA, obviously.

We'll see how this plays out.

## Article 3: My Dumbest Trade of 2024 (And What I Learned)

I'm going to tell you about the time I lost $47,000 in three days because I was right about everything except the one thing that mattered.

This isn't a fun story. It's not going to have a clever twist where I made it all back. I just... lost the money. And then I had to sit with that and figure out what the hell went wrong.

Spoiler alert: user error.

### The Setup (Where I Convince Myself I'm Smart)

It was late February 2024. The market had been ripping higher for weeks - S&P up 6% year-to-date, tech leading, volatility crushed. Everyone was talking about the "no landing" scenario where growth stays strong and inflation magically goes away.

I thought this was nonsense.

The data wasn't supporting the narrative. Inflation prints were still sticky. The Fed was holding rates higher for longer. Credit card delinquencies were rising. Commercial real estate was a dumpster fire. And equity valuations were pricing in absolute perfection.

Look, I'm not a permabear. But when risk-reward is asymmetric, you position for downside.

So I built what I thought was a perfect trade: short S&P 500 via put spreads, long VIX calls, and short credit via high yield ETF puts. A diversified bet on a correction with defined risk.

The position sizing was aggressive but not insane. If I was right, I'd make 3-4x my risk. If I was wrong, I'd lose my premium and move on.

Here's the thing: I was right about almost everything.

### The Trade (Where I Execute Flawlessly on a Flawed Plan)

I entered the position on February 23rd across three structures:

**Position 1: SPX Put Spread**
- Short SPX at 5,050 level (market was ~5,080)
- Bought 5,000/4,900 put spreads expiring March 15th
- Spent $85,000 in premium for $500,000 notional exposure
- Break-even on a 2-3% correction

**Position 2: VIX Calls**
- Bought March VIX 18 calls (VIX was at 13)
- Spent $25,000 in premium
- Bet on volatility spike during correction

**Position 3: HYG Puts**
- Bought HYG (high yield ETF) puts, 2% out of the money
- Spent $20,000 in premium
- Bet on credit widening during equity weakness

Total capital at risk: $130,000. Potential max gain: $400,000+. Sharpe ratio of the portfolio structure: looked great in my risk model.

What could go wrong?

### What Went Wrong (Literally Everything That Could)

The market didn't crash. It didn't even correct.

It just... kept going up.

Feb 26: SPX +0.8%. My positions down 12%.

Feb 27: SPX +0.5%. My positions down 24%.

Feb 28: SPX +0.3%. My positions down 35%.

The math was brutal. Short-dated options experience accelerating time decay. Every day the market didn't sell off, my positions lost value exponentially.

But here's where I made my first mistake: I didn't cut the position.

Why? Because I was still right about the fundamentals. The setup hadn't changed. Valuations were still extended. Volatility was still too low. The thesis was intact.

The question is: when do you admit that being right doesn't matter if the market disagrees?

I didn't have an answer. So I held.

### The Psychological Torture (AKA The Week From Hell)

Let me tell you what it's like to watch $47,000 evaporate in real-time:

Day 1: Annoying. Markets are irrational, this will turn around.

Day 2: Concerning. Maybe I should hedge this. (I don't.)

Day 3: Painful. Okay, this is actually costing real money now.

Day 4: Desperate. Come on, just one down day and I can salvage this.

Day 5: Capitulation. I close the positions for massive losses.

The S&P never pulled back. Not even 1%. It just grinded higher on low volume with VIX pinned at 13.

My final P&L: -$47,000 (roughly -36% of capital at risk).

The SPX put spreads expired worthless. The VIX calls expired worthless. The HYG puts lost 80% before I closed them.

I was right that valuations were extended (they still are). Right that volatility was too low (it still is). Right that credit spreads were too tight (they still are).

I was wrong about one thing: timing.

And in options trading, timing is literally the only thing that matters.

### What I Should Have Done (The Painful Retrospective)

Let's break down my mistakes with the cold clarity of hindsight:

**Mistake #1: Duration Mismatch**

I used short-dated options (3 weeks) to express a medium-term view (1-3 months). This is like using a sledgehammer for brain surgery - wrong tool for the job.

If I believed a correction was coming but didn't know when, I should have used longer-dated options or spreads. Yes, they're more expensive. But they give you time to be right.

The math: my position lost $47,000 in 5 days. If I'd used June expiry instead of March, I'd have lost maybe $8,000 in the same period and still had the position on.

**Mistake #2: No Exit Plan**

I entered the trade with a clear thesis but no defined risk management rules.

When do you cut a losing trade? When:
- The thesis is invalidated? (It wasn't)
- You lose X% of capital? (I had no rule)
- Time decay reaches a certain point? (I had no rule)

I had none of these. So I just... sat there bleeding money and hoping for a miracle.

What I should have done: "If position is down 15% after 3 days with no signs of market weakness, cut 50%. If down 25%, cut entirely."

Simple. Clear. Unemotional.

I didn't have that, so emotions made the decision for me (badly).

**Mistake #3: Position Sizing Based on Conviction Instead of Math**

I believed strongly in the thesis, so I sized the position aggressively.

This is backwards.

Position sizing should be based on:
- Probability of being right
- Magnitude of loss if wrong
- Time horizon
- Correlation to other positions

Not on how smart you think you are.

If I'd properly modeled the probability of the market going straight up for 5+ days (which is actually pretty high historically), I'd have sized this at 50% of what I did.

**Mistake #4: Ignoring Market Regime**

Here's the thing I missed: we were in a momentum regime.

When the market is trending strongly (up or down), counter-trend positions require perfect timing. The trend has to break before you enter, not while you're in the position hoping it breaks.

I knew this intellectually. I've written about it. But when you're convinced you're right, you ignore inconvenient facts.

The consensus was momentum-driven continuation. I thought I was smarter than consensus. I wasn't.

### What I Actually Learned (Beyond "Don't Lose Money")

Losing $47,000 taught me more than any winning trade has.

**Lesson 1: Being Right Doesn't Matter**

Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent - shocking, I know, this is not new wisdom. But internalizing it emotionally is different from knowing it intellectually.

You can have perfect fundamental analysis and still lose money. The market doesn't care about your thesis. It cares about supply and demand, positioning, flows, and momentum.

Trade the market you have, not the market you think should exist.

**Lesson 2: Time Horizon Discipline**

Match your instrument duration to your view duration. If you think something will happen in 3 months, don't use 3-week options.

This seems obvious in retrospect. But in the moment, short-dated options are so much cheaper that they're seductive. Resist the temptation.

**Lesson 3: Risk Management Is Not Optional**

Every trade needs:
- Entry criteria (when to put it on)
- Exit criteria (when to take it off)
- Position sizing rules (how much to risk)
- Maximum loss threshold (when to admit defeat)

I had entry criteria. I didn't have the rest. That's not trading - that's gambling.

**Lesson 4: Emotion Detection Matters**

The moment I started thinking "come on, just one down day" I should have known I was in trouble.

When you're hoping for the market to save you, you've already lost control of the trade. Hope is not a strategy.

I now have a mental checklist: if I'm emotionally invested in a trade outcome beyond normal risk management, something is wrong with the position.

**Lesson 5: Document Everything**

I've started keeping a trade journal. Not P&L tracking - that's easy. But the qualitative stuff:

- Why did I enter?
- What was my conviction level?
- How did I feel during the trade?
- What would I do differently?

Writing this article is part of that process. Documenting my failures helps me not repeat them.

We'll see how that works out.

### The Silver Lining (If You Can Call It That)

I didn't blow up. The loss was painful but not catastrophic. My portfolio was down 4-5% for the month - bad, but survivable.

More importantly: I learned more from this loss than I have from months of winning trades.

Winning can make you sloppy. You start thinking you're smarter than you are. You cut corners on risk management because "it's been working."

Losing forces you to confront your process. Are you actually good at this, or have you just been lucky? Is your edge real, or is it statistical noise?

I still think I have edge. But this trade reminded me that edge without discipline is just expensive entertainment.

### Bottom Line

I lost $47,000 because I:
- Used the wrong instrument duration for my time horizon
- Didn't have clear risk management rules
- Sized based on conviction instead of probability
- Ignored the market regime
- Let emotions override process

Was the thesis wrong? No. Market is still overvalued. Volatility is still compressed. Credit spreads are still too tight.

But being right doesn't matter if your execution is flawed.

The market will always give you opportunities to be humbled. The question is whether you learn from it or repeat the mistake with different names and dates.

I'm trying to do the former.

No guarantees it's working.

NFA, obviously.

## Article 4: The 3 Metrics That Actually Matter

Let me guess: you're tracking your portfolio returns.

Up 12% this year? Great. Up 27%? Even better. You're beating the S&P, feeling smart, maybe telling friends about it at dinner parties.

Here's the thing: returns don't tell you anything useful by themselves.

Everyone thinks higher returns = better performance. The consensus is wrong because return without context is meaningless. You can have incredible returns and still be a terrible trader. You can have modest returns and be exceptional.

What actually matters? Three metrics that most retail investors completely ignore:

1. Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
2. Maximum Drawdown (how badly things can go wrong)
3. Win Rate (consistency of your process)

Let me explain why these matter more than your absolute returns, and why most people are optimizing for the wrong thing.

### Metric #1: Sharpe Ratio (Are You Actually Good or Just Lucky?)

The Sharpe ratio measures return per unit of risk. The formula is simple:

**Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk Free Rate) / Standard Deviation of Returns**

Translation: how much return are you generating for each unit of volatility you're taking?

Let's compare two traders:

**Trader A:**
- Returns: 30% per year
- Volatility: 25% standard deviation
- Sharpe Ratio: (30% - 4%) / 25% = 1.04

**Trader B:**
- Returns: 18% per year
- Volatility: 8% standard deviation
- Sharpe Ratio: (18% - 4%) / 8% = 1.75

Who's better? Everyone picks Trader A because 30% > 18%.

Wrong. Trader B is significantly better on a risk-adjusted basis.

Why does this matter? Because volatility kills you in two ways:

First, psychological. When your portfolio swings 5% daily, you make emotional decisions. You cut winners too early, hold losers too long, and generally trade like an idiot.

Second, mathematical. Volatility compounds negatively. If you're up 20% then down 20%, you're not flat - you're down 4%. The larger your swings, the harder it is to compound wealth.

Look, nobody wants to hear this because we're all wired to chase maximum returns. But the math is simple: consistent risk-adjusted returns beat volatile high returns over any meaningful time horizon.

### What's A Good Sharpe Ratio?

Here's the benchmark:

- **Below 1.0:** You're barely being compensated for risk. Might as well buy index funds.
- **1.0 - 2.0:** Decent. Better than most retail traders.
- **2.0 - 3.0:** Excellent. You're in institutional territory.
- **Above 3.0:** Suspicious. You're either a genius, using massive leverage, or about to blow up.

The S&P 500 historically has a Sharpe around 0.4-0.5. If you're running a Sharpe below that, you're literally worse than buying and holding SPY.

My current portfolio Sharpe is around 1.9. Is that good? Yes. Is it sustainable? We'll see how this plays out.

The question is: what's yours?

If you don't know, you're flying blind.

### How To Calculate Your Sharpe (Without A PhD)

You need three things:

1. **Your average monthly return** (add up all monthly returns, divide by number of months)
2. **Standard deviation of monthly returns** (use =STDEV() function in Excel on your monthly return column)
3. **Risk-free rate** (use current 3-month Treasury rate, roughly 4-5% annually = 0.33-0.42% monthly)

Then: Sharpe = (Average Monthly Return - Risk Free Rate) / Standard Deviation

Multiply by sqrt(12) to annualize it.

If this sounds complicated, good news: most brokerage platforms will calculate it for you. ThinkorSwim, Interactive Brokers, and Sharesight all show Sharpe ratios.

If yours don't, get better tools.

### Metric #2: Maximum Drawdown (Can You Survive Your Worst Day?)

Maximum drawdown measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in your portfolio value.

Example: Your portfolio hits $100,000, then drops to $75,000, then recovers to $110,000.

Your maximum drawdown = -25% (the worst it got from peak to trough).

Everyone focuses on gains. Nobody talks about drawdowns until they experience one.

Bottom line: drawdowns matter more than returns because they determine whether you survive.

### The Brutal Math of Drawdowns

Here's what people don't understand:

If you lose 20%, you need a 25% gain to recover.
If you lose 33%, you need a 50% gain to recover.
If you lose 50%, you need a 100% gain to recover.

The math is asymmetric. Losses hurt exponentially more than gains help.

This is why institutional investors obsess over drawdown limits. A hedge fund with -20% drawdown might lose all its assets under management even if it recovers later. Investors bail during drawdowns.

For retail traders, the problem is psychological. Can you actually handle watching your portfolio drop 30% without panic selling? Most people think they can. Very few actually can.

### What's An Acceptable Drawdown?

Depends on your strategy and risk tolerance:

- **Index investing:** -30 to -50% drawdowns are normal. You accept this for long-term equity returns.
- **Conservative strategies:** -10 to -15% max drawdown. Lower returns but sleepable risk.
- **Aggressive strategies:** -20 to -30% drawdown. Higher returns but brutal psychologically.
- **Leveraged strategies:** -50%+ drawdowns are possible. Only for professionals or masochists.

My maximum acceptable drawdown is -20%. If my portfolio ever goes down 20% from peak, I reduce risk across all strategies until I understand what broke.

Current max drawdown in 2024: -11% (happened in April during a vol spike). Painful but within tolerance.

What's yours? If you've never experienced a significant drawdown, you either:
1. Haven't been trading long enough
2. Got lucky
3. Are about to learn an expensive lesson

Plan accordingly.

### How To Manage Drawdowns

You can't avoid drawdowns. But you can control their magnitude:

1. **Position sizing:** Never risk more than 2-3% of portfolio on any single trade. This limits damage from individual losses.

2. **Stop losses:** Define maximum loss tolerance before entering every trade. No exceptions.

3. **Diversification:** Uncorrelated strategies smooth drawdowns. When one thing blows up, others might be fine.

4. **Leverage control:** Leverage amplifies drawdowns exponentially. A 20% drawdown with 3x leverage = -60%. Can you survive that?

5. **Volatility-based sizing:** When market vol spikes, reduce position sizes automatically. Most catastrophic drawdowns happen during vol regime changes.

I use automated risk management rules tied to portfolio volatility. When daily portfolio vol exceeds 1.5%, I automatically reduce exposure by 30%. When it exceeds 2%, I cut to 50% exposure.

Does this mean I miss some returns? Yes. Does it mean I survive tail events? Also yes.

### Metric #3: Win Rate (Are You Consistent or Gambling?)

Win rate = percentage of trades that are profitable.

If you make 100 trades and 60 are winners, your win rate is 60%.

Everyone thinks higher win rate = better trader. Not quite.

What actually matters is the relationship between win rate and average win/loss size. You can have a 40% win rate and print money. You can have a 70% win rate and go broke.

The math: **Expected Value = (Win Rate × Avg Win) - (Loss Rate × Avg Loss)**

### The Win Rate Paradox

Two traders:

**Trader A:**
- Win rate: 70%
- Average win: $500
- Average loss: $1,500
- Expected value per trade: (0.7 × $500) - (0.3 × $1,500) = $350 - $450 = **-$100**

**Trader B:**
- Win rate: 40%
- Average win: $2,000
- Average loss: $500
- Expected value per trade: (0.4 × $2,000) - (0.6 × $500) = $800 - $300 = **+$500**

Trader A wins more often but loses money. Trader B loses more often but makes money.

Plot twist: most retail traders are Trader A. They take small profits and let losses run (the exact opposite of what works).

### What's A Good Win Rate?

Depends entirely on your strategy:

- **Trend following:** 35-45% win rate is normal. You lose often but winners are huge.
- **Mean reversion:** 55-65% win rate is normal. You win often but winners are smaller.
- **Market making:** 70-80% win rate is possible. But losses can be catastrophic.
- **Options selling:** 70-85% win rate is common. But occasional losses can wipe out months of gains.

My systematic strategies run around 58% win rate. Not spectacular, but combined with 1.8:1 average win/loss ratio, the math works.

What matters more than win rate alone: **consistency**. If your win rate is 60% over 1,000 trades, that's a signal. If it's 60% over 20 trades, that's noise.

### How To Calculate Your Win Rate (And Why It Might Be Bullsh*t)

Take your last 50-100 trades (minimum):

1. Count how many were profitable = W
2. Count how many were losers = L
3. Win rate = W / (W + L)

Now calculate:
- Average win size
- Average loss size
- Ratio = Avg Win / Avg Loss

If your ratio is above 1.5 and win rate is above 50%, you're in good shape. If ratio is below 1.0, you need a 60%+ win rate just to break even.

But here's the catch: sample size matters.

20 trades tells you nothing. 100 trades is barely significant. 500+ trades starts to be meaningful.

Most retail traders dramatically overestimate their win rate because they have tiny sample sizes and selective memory.

### Why Most People Optimize For The Wrong Things

Here's what retail investors track:
- Absolute returns (meaningless without risk context)
- Whether they "beat the market" (wrong benchmark for most strategies)
- Individual trade outcomes (outcome bias, not process evaluation)

What they should track:
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Drawdown tolerance (can I survive the worst case?)
- Win rate vs. win/loss ratio (is my edge real?)

The numbers tell a different story than emotions do.

You can feel like a genius because you made 40% returns this year. But if you took massive risk (low Sharpe), experienced a -35% drawdown that almost made you quit, and have a 45% win rate with terrible win/loss ratio, you didn't have skill - you had luck.

### The Bottom Line (What Actually Matters)

If you take away one thing from this article, it's this:

**Returns without context are meaningless. Risk-adjusted returns, drawdown management, and win rate consistency are what separate professional traders from lucky amateurs.**

Track these three metrics:

1. **Sharpe Ratio > 1.0** (minimum), ideally 1.5-2.0+
2. **Max Drawdown < 20-25%** for most strategies
3. **Win Rate × Win/Loss Ratio > 1.0** (positive expected value)

If you hit these targets, you're in the top 10% of retail traders. If you don't know what your numbers are, you're gambling with extra steps.

I check these metrics weekly. They tell me whether my strategies are working or whether I'm about to learn an expensive lesson.

Current Alpha Loop Capital stats:
- Sharpe: 1.9
- Max DD: -11%
- Win rate: 58%, Win/Loss ratio: 1.8

Are these good enough to run a fund? We'll see how this plays out.

What are yours?

## Article 5: What My AI Agents Taught Me About Trading

I've spent the last 18 months building an AI agent system for trading.

Not because it's trendy (though it is). Not because I think AI will replace human traders (it won't, yet). But because I wanted to see if machines could do something I couldn't: process information without emotions, biases, or ego.

Spoiler alert: they can. Sort of.

But what surprised me wasn't how good the agents are at trading. It was what building them taught me about my own decision-making process - and how badly I was doing it.

This is the stuff I wish someone had told me five years ago.

### What I Built (And Why)

Alpha Loop Capital runs on an agent-based architecture. We have specialized AI agents that:

- **THE_SCANNER** monitors markets 24/7, identifies anomalies and opportunities
- **THE_ANALYZER** processes market data, generates trade ideas with probabilities
- **THE_RISK_MANAGER** enforces position limits, calculates portfolio-level risk
- **THE_EXECUTOR** handles order placement, execution optimization
- **THE_REPORTER** generates performance reports, tracks metrics

Each agent has a specific job. They communicate via a shared knowledge graph. They don't have emotions, don't get tired, and don't care about being right.

Building this system took longer and was harder than I expected (shocking, I know). But the process forced me to codify every aspect of my trading process into explicit rules.

Here's the thing: when you have to explain your trading logic to a machine, you realize how much of it is vibes-based nonsense.

### Lesson #1: Most Of My "Edge" Was Superstition

I thought I had a great process. I'd been trading successfully for years. I knew what I was doing.

Then I tried to program it into an agent.

**Me:** "THE_ANALYZER, when RSI is oversold and price is at support, we buy."

**Agent:** "Define 'support.' Define 'oversold.' Define buy size. Define hold duration. Define exit criteria."

**Me:** "Uh... you know, support. Where it bounced before."

**Agent:** "How many times must it bounce to qualify? What percentage proximity constitutes 'at support'? What if multiple support levels exist?"

**Me:** "..."

Turns out, 80% of what I thought was "my process" was just pattern recognition mixed with confirmation bias. I'd see what I wanted to see, tell a story about why it made sense, and execute.

Sometimes it worked. But I couldn't articulate why in a way that was consistently replicable.

The question is: if you can't codify your edge, do you actually have edge or just selective memory of winners?

### What I Changed

I started documenting every trade decision with specific entry criteria:

- **Bad:** "Support looks strong here"
- **Good:** "Price within 2% of 50-day MA with 3+ bounces in last 6 months, RSI < 35"

- **Bad:** "Volatility seems high"
- **Good:** "30-day realized vol > 1.5x 90-day average, VIX term structure inverted"

The process was brutal. Every vague intuition had to become a testable rule.

But here's what happened: my Sharpe ratio improved by 0.4 points. Not because the agents are smarter than me, but because they forced me to be explicit about what I was actually doing.

### Lesson #2: I Was Catastrophically Bad At Position Sizing

I thought I was disciplined about risk management.

"I never risk more than 2-3% per trade" - I'd tell people this confidently.

Then I built THE_RISK_MANAGER and had it analyze my historical trades.

Plot twist: I was full of it.

The agent showed me that my actual position sizing was all over the place:
- High conviction trades: 4-5% risk (way too much)
- Medium conviction: 1-2% risk (about right)
- "Just testing": 0.5% risk (too small to matter)

Worse, my position sizing was based on conviction, not probability. When I really believed in a trade, I'd size up. When I was uncertain, I'd size down.

This is exactly backwards.

**What actually works:** Position sizing based on:
1. Edge magnitude (expected value)
2. Confidence interval (probability distribution)
3. Correlation to existing positions
4. Current portfolio volatility

Not vibes.

### What I Changed

I now use the Kelly Criterion (modified) for position sizing:

**Position Size = (Edge / Odds) × Confidence Modifier**

Where:
- Edge = expected win rate × avg win - expected loss rate × avg loss
- Odds = average win / average loss ratio
- Confidence modifier = downward adjustment for uncertainty (usually 0.25-0.5)

Example:
- Strategy has 58% win rate, 1.8:1 win/loss ratio
- Edge = (0.58 × 1.8) - (0.42 × 1) = 1.044 - 0.42 = 0.624
- Odds = 1.8
- Kelly = 0.624 / 1.8 = 34.7%
- Confidence modifier = 0.25
- **Actual position size = 8.7% of portfolio**

This is way more aggressive than my old "2-3% per trade" rule, but it's mathematically optimal for strategies with proven edge.

The agent does this calculation automatically for every trade. I just review and approve.

Result: portfolio returns up ~15% while Sharpe ratio improved. The math works.

### Lesson #3: My Entry Timing Was Fine, My Exit Timing Was Terrible

Building THE_EXECUTOR revealed something uncomfortable: I was decent at finding trades but awful at managing them.

The agent tracked my historical exits and categorized them:

- **Optimal exits** (within 10% of best possible): 23%
- **Acceptable exits** (captured 50-80% of potential): 41%
- **Poor exits** (left 50%+ on table): 28%
- **Premature exits** (stopped out before thesis played out): 8%

Look, nobody hits perfect exits. But leaving money on the table 36% of the time (poor + premature) is expensive.

The problem? I was making exit decisions emotionally:
- Taking profits too early because I was nervous about giving back gains
- Holding losers too long because I didn't want to admit I was wrong
- Cutting positions on volatility spikes even when thesis was intact

Classic retail trader mistakes.

### What I Changed

THE_EXECUTOR now manages exits based on rules, not feelings:

**Rule 1: Take Partial Profits at Targets**
- 33% at +1R (1× initial risk)
- 33% at +2R
- 33% trailing stop on remainder

**Rule 2: Cut Losses at Hard Stops**
- Stop loss = 1R (no exceptions)
- No "giving it more room" or "waiting to see"

**Rule 3: Time-Based Exits**
- If trade hasn't moved in 5 days, review thesis
- If thesis invalid, exit immediately regardless of P&L

**Rule 4: Volatility-Adjusted Stops**
- Widen stops when vol increases (less likely to get shaken out)
- Tighten stops when vol decreases (preserve profits)

Is this perfect? No. Do I still override the agent sometimes? Yes (usually badly).

But having explicit exit rules means I can't lie to myself about why I'm holding or selling.

### Lesson #4: Backtests Are Lies (But Useful Lies)

THE_ANALYZER can backtest strategies instantly. I've run thousands of backtests across different strategies, timeframes, and market conditions.

Here's what I learned: backtests are basically fan fiction.

They show you what would have happened if:
- You executed perfectly with no emotions
- Slippage was minimal and consistent
- You never got scared during drawdowns
- Black swan events didn't change market structure
- Your indicators always worked as expected

In other words: fiction.

Real trading is:
- Execution delays and slippage
- Emotional decision making during stress
- Regime changes that break your models
- Unexpected correlations during crises
- Technology failures at the worst possible times

Every backtest needs a "reality tax" - assume your actual performance will be 30-50% worse than backtest shows.

### What I Changed

I now stress-test every strategy with:

1. **Pessimistic assumptions:** Double expected slippage, increase cost estimates, assume worse execution
2. **Drawdown simulation:** What if your worst backtest drawdown is 2× worse live?
3. **Regime change analysis:** Does strategy work in different volatility/trend/correlation regimes?
4. **Tail risk assessment:** What if 2008, 2020, or 2022 happens again?

If a strategy can't survive pessimistic assumptions, it doesn't go live.

Current rule: backtest Sharpe × 0.6 = expected live Sharpe. If that's still above 1.0, deploy.

We'll see how this plays out.

### Lesson #5: Machines Are Better At Following Rules, Humans Are Better At Knowing When To Break Them

Here's the paradox of agent-based trading:

The agents are perfect at execution. They never panic. They never get greedy. They follow rules precisely.

But sometimes the rules are wrong.

Example: March 2023, banking crisis hits. SVB collapses, Credit Suisse wobbles, markets gap down violently.

THE_ANALYZER sees volatility spike and correlation break down. It wants to cut all positions per risk management rules.

But I override it.

Why? Because I can see that this is a liquidity crisis, not a fundamental collapse. The Fed will backstop banks. This is a buying opportunity, not a selling event.

The agent can't make that judgment. It just sees statistics deviating from norms.

Human intuition - informed by experience, market context, and macro understanding - knew the rules needed to be broken.

We held positions. Market recovered within days. We were right.

Bottom line: agents are better at discipline. Humans are better at discretion. The optimal approach is hybrid.

### What This Means For Trading

You don't need AI agents to be a good trader. But the process of building them teaches you something critical:

**If you can't explicitly articulate your edge, you probably don't have one.**

Try this exercise:

1. Take your last 10 trades
2. Write down the exact entry criteria for each (be specific)
3. Write down the exact exit criteria for each
4. Write down the position sizing logic
5. Check if you actually followed your own rules

I guarantee you'll find inconsistencies, vibes-based decisions, and retroactive storytelling.

That's not edge. That's gambling with extra steps.

The agents force me to be honest about my process. They can't lie to themselves about why they took a trade. Neither should you.

### The Surprising Part

The most valuable thing about building AI agents wasn't the performance improvement (though that's nice).

It was realizing how much of my trading was based on ego, narrative, and confirmation bias rather than actual edge.

The agents don't care about being right. They care about expected value.
The agents don't care about narrative. They care about probability.
The agents don't care about ego. They care about results.

I'm trying to be more like that.

It's harder than it sounds.

### Bottom Line

Building an AI agent system taught me:

1. Most of my "process" was superstition and pattern recognition
2. My position sizing was emotion-driven, not math-driven
3. My exits were systematically bad
4. Backtests are useful lies that need reality adjustments
5. Machines enforce discipline, humans provide context

You don't need agents to improve. You just need to be honest about whether your edge is real or imagined.

Write down your rules. Follow them consistently. Track results objectively. Adjust based on data, not feelings.

If you can't explain your trading process to a machine, you probably can't explain it to yourself either.
